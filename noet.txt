help me make a "4 digit password smart door lock" simulation in Vivado VHDL VHD with separate files for each component to main.vhd
my plan is to plug PmodKPD to port JA and use it as input.
the output is the 1st 4 digits of the left side 8 digit 7seg to show what the password was just entered from keypad.
if correct or error, generate a tone of bad or good sound.
and display on the right side 8 digit 7segment like "FAIL" or "gOod" to it.

the alphabets in the keypad can be set to this:
A = Accept or check if the password is the same, if yes it opens and triggers good tone and "GOOD"
B = Backspace or delete the previous digit
C = Clear all 4 digits
D = bypass or override, imagine like its the indoor button of a hotel door
E = Empty or reset the password
F = Fill or set the password
